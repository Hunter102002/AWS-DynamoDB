# AWS Dynamo Project

## Objective

The AWS DynamoDB project focused on designing and implementing a scalable and high-performance database solution using Amazon DynamoDB. The objective was to develop a database architecture that could efficiently handle large-scale data storage and retrieval requirements. This project aimed to deepen understanding of NoSQL database concepts, DynamoDB's features, and best practices for designing scalable applications.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Understanding of NoSQL database concepts and DynamoDB's key-value and document data model.
- Proficiency in designing DynamoDB tables, including defining primary keys, indexes, and capacity requirements.
- Implementation of efficient data access patterns using DynamoDB Query and Scan operations.
- Optimization of DynamoDB performance through capacity planning, partition management, and indexing strategies.
- Knowledge of DynamoDB security practices, including authentication, authorization, and encryption options.

### Tools Used

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) for provisioning DynamoDB resources.
- AWS Management Console and AWS SDKs for interacting with DynamoDB.
- DynamoDB Local for offline development and testing.
- AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code (IaC) to deploy DynamoDB resources.
